The pipeline follows a structured approach to process text, extract relevant task details, and format them into a structured JSON output.  \n\nThe deliverables for this assignment include:  \n1. **A short video walkthrough** demonstrating the code and its output.  \n2. **A well-documented Notebook**, including modular functions for **preprocessing, task extraction, categorization, and validation** using manually curated test cases.  \n\n### **Overview of the NLP Pipeline**  \n\nThe **full NLP pipeline** code is provided, covering all the essential steps for **task extraction, categorization, and structuring output.** The workflow consists of four key steps:  \n\n- **Step 1: Preprocessing the Text and Extracting Tasks from Text**  \n  - Tokenization and sentence segmentation  \n  - Identifying key task-related phrases  \n  - Extracting potential tasks from sentences  \n\n- **Step 2: Categorizing Extracted Tasks**  \n  - Assigning tasks to relevant categories (Work, Personal, Academic, Health, etc.)  \n  - Expanding categorization using **keywords and topic modeling**  \n\n- **Step 3: Extracting \"Who\" and \"When\" from Tasks**  \n  - Identifying **who** is responsible for the task  \n  - Extracting **when** (deadline/time) using **regex and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  \n\n- **Step 4: Structuring the Final Output in JSON Format**  \n  - Formatting extracted tasks into a **structured JSON**  \n  - Ensuring data is well-structured for storage and API use  \n\nThis approach ensures that tasks are accurately identified, categorized, and structured in a **machine-readable format**, making it easier for downstream applications to process the information.  \n\nThe code is designed to be **modular, reusable, and efficient**, following best practices in NLP and text processing. **All functions are well-documented,** and test cases have been included to validate the results.  \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Extract and Categorize Tasks NLP PIPELINE**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import spacy\nimport re\nimport json\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Load spaCy English model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Task-related phrases\nTASK_KEYWORDS = [\n    \"has to\", \"needs to\", \"should\", \"must\", \"is required to\", \"is expected to\", \n    \"is supposed to\", \"is scheduled to\", \"is assigned to\"\n]\n\n# Deadline patterns\nTIME_PATTERNS = [\n    r'\\bby\\s+\\d{1,2}\\s*(am|pm)?\\b',  # \"by 5 pm\"\n    r'\\bbefore\\s+\\w+\\b',  # \"before tomorrow\"\n    r'\\btomorrow\\b',\n    r'\\btoday\\b',\n    r'\\bin\\s+\\d+\\s+\\w+\\b',  # \"in 3 hours\"\n    r'\\bby end of the day\\b',\n    r'\\bwithin\\s+\\d+\\s+(hours|days|minutes)\\b'\n]\n\n# Categorization keywords\nTASK_CATEGORIES = {\n    \"Personal\": [\"buy\", \"get\", \"shop\", \"visit\"],\n    \"Academic\": [\"submit\", \"study\", \"complete\", \"assignment\", \"exam\", \"project\"],\n    \"Work\": [\"send\", \"email\", \"call\", \"schedule\", \"meeting\", \"review\"],\n    \"Household\": [\"clean\", \"wash\", \"cook\", \"arrange\", \"fix\"],\n    \"Health\": [\"exercise\", \"run\", \"walk\", \"meditate\"],\n    \"Finance\": [\"pay\", \"invest\", \"deposit\", \"withdraw\", \"budget\"]\n}\n\ndef extract_and_categorize_pipeline(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    NLP pipeline to extract tasks, categorize them, and structure the output.\n    \"\"\"\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    extracted_tasks = []\n\n    for sent in doc.sents:\n        sentence = sent.text.strip()\n        sentence_lower = sentence.lower()\n        \n        # Check if the sentence contains a task-related phrase\n        if any(keyword in sentence_lower for keyword in TASK_KEYWORDS):\n            task = {\"who\": None, \"task\": None, \"deadline\": None, \"category\": \"Uncategorized\"}\n\n            # Extract the subject (who)\n            subjects = [token.text for token in sent if token.dep_ in {\"nsubj\", \"nsubjpass\"} and token.pos_ in {\"PROPN\", \"PRON\"}]\n            task[\"who\"] = \", \".join(subjects) if subjects else \"Unknown\"\n\n            # Extract the task (everything after the task phrase)\n            task_start = -1\n            for keyword in TASK_KEYWORDS:\n                if keyword in sentence_lower:\n                    task_start = sentence_lower.find(keyword) + len(keyword)\n                    break\n            \n            if task_start != -1:\n                task_text = sentence[task_start:].strip()\n                task[\"task\"] = task_text\n\n            # Extract deadline\n            for pattern in TIME_PATTERNS:\n                match = re.search(pattern, sentence_lower)\n                if match:\n                    task[\"deadline\"] = match.group(0)\n                    break\n\n            # Use NER for additional date extraction\n            for ent in sent.ents:\n                if ent.label_ in {\"DATE\", \"TIME\"}:\n                    task[\"deadline\"] = ent.text\n                    break\n\n            # Categorize the task\n            for category, keywords in TASK_CATEGORIES.items():\n                if any(keyword in task[\"task\"].lower() for keyword in keywords):\n                    task[\"category\"] = category\n                    break\n\n            # Store valid tasks\n            if task[\"task\"]:\n                extracted_tasks.append(task)\n\n    return extracted_tasks\n\n\ndef format_output(tasks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert extracted tasks into a structured JSON output.\n    \"\"\"\n    return json.dumps(tasks, indent=4)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-05T16:55:12.974463Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-05T16:55:12.974968Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-05T16:55:20.510854Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-05T16:55:12.974918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-05T16:55:20.509545Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Test Cases\ntest_texts = [\n    \"Rahul wakes up early every day.
