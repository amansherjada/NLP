The `s?` part makes the `s` optional, so it matches both `http` and `https`.\n   - `\\S+`: Matches one or more non-whitespace characters, effectively capturing the entire URL.\n   - `|`: Acts as an OR operator, meaning the pattern will match either the left side (`https?://\\S+`) or the right side (`www\\.\\S+`).\n   - `www\\.\\S+`: Matches URLs starting with `www.` followed by one or more non-whitespace characters.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text1 = 'Check out my Facecook https://www.facebook.com/'\ntext2 = 'Check out my Instagram https://www.instagram.com/'\ntext3 = 'Google search here www.google.com'\ntext4 = 'For GitHub click https://github.com/ to search check www.google.com'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.044746Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.045054Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.052070Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.045025Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.051142Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"remove_url(text2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.053120Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.053384Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.060822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.053355Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.059989Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"execution_count":13,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Check out my Instagram '"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Removing Punctuation\n</b></div>\n\nIn NLP, removing punctuation helps:\n\n1. **Simplify Text**: Reduces complexity for processing.\n2. **Normalize Data**: Ensures uniform text format.\n3. **Improve Tokenization**: Prevents punctuation from affecting word splits.\n4. **Enhance Model Performance**: Focuses on meaningful content for better results.\n5. **Size**: Punctuation makes the document large.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import string, time\nstring.punctuation","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.061795Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.062062Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.069355Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.062039Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.068555Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'!\"#$%&\\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"exclude = string.punctuation\nexclude","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.070402Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.070985Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.078058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.070959Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.077294Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'!\"#$%&\\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def remove_punctuation(text):\n    for char in exclude:\n        text = text.replace(char, \"\")\n    return text","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.078976Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.079242Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.085157Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.079219Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:46.084421Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text = \"Hello, world!

Here's why it matters:\n\n1. **Emotional Context**: Emojis provide emotional cues such as happiness 😊, sadness 😢, or surprise 😮, which are crucial for sentiment analysis and understanding the tone of text.\n\n2. **Enhanced Meaning**: They enrich the meaning of text by adding nuances that words alone might not express effectively. For example, \"I'm excited!\" might convey more with a 😃 emoji.\n\n3. **Communication Style**: Emojis reflect modern communication styles and can impact how messages are interpreted in social media, customer feedback, or online reviews.\n\n4. **Choice of Handling**: Depending on the application, emojis can be removed to focus purely on textual analysis, or they can be replaced with their textual description (emojis like 😊 become \"smiling face with smiling eyes\").","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Removing Emojis\ndef remove_emoji(text):\n    emoji_pattern=re.compile(\"[\"\n                             u\"\\U0001F600-\\U0001F64F\" #emoticons\n                             u\"\\U0001F300-\\U0001F5FF\" #symbols, pictograph\n                              u\"\\U0001F680-\\U0001F6FF\" #transport and map symbol\n                              u\"\\U0001F1E0-\\U0001F1FF\" #flags(IOS)\n                              u\"\\U00002702-\\U000027B0\"\n                              u\"\\U00002FC2-\\U0001F251\"\n                             \"]+\",flags=re.UNICODE)\n    return emoji_pattern.sub(r'',text)\n\ntext=\"I'm so excited for the party tonight! 🎉 Can't wait to see everyone there! 😄\"\nremove_emoji(text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:47.924829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:47.925116Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:47.936747Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:47.925087Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:47.935888Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"execution_count":30,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"I'm so excited for the party tonight!

These tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the application. Think of it like cutting a paragraph into smaller, manageable parts.\n\n#### Example:\n\nImagine you have this sentence:\n\n```plaintext\nI love eating pizza!\n```\n\nWhen we tokenize it into words, it becomes:\n\n```plaintext\n[\"I\", \"love\", \"eating\", \"pizza\", \"!\"]\n```\n\nEach word and punctuation mark becomes a separate token.\n\n#### Why Do We Use Tokenization in NLP?\n\n1. **Easier Analysis**: Breaking text into tokens makes it easier to analyze. It's like reading a book one word at a time instead of trying to understand it all at once.\n   \n2. **Understanding Context**: It helps in understanding the context of each word in a sentence. For example, knowing that \"love\" is followed by \"eating\" gives a clear picture of the meaning.\n\n3. **Efficient Processing**: Computers can process and analyze tokens more efficiently than long strings of text. It speeds up tasks like searching for specific words or understanding the structure of sentences.\n\n4. **Building Blocks for NLP Tasks**: Tokenization is the first step for many NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and text summarization. It prepares the text for more complex processing.\n\nTokenization helps break down text into smaller, understandable parts, making it easier for computers to analyze and work with.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

It's like finding the \"stem\" of a word, which can help us understand different variations of the same word.\n\n### Example:\n\nImagine you have these words:\n\n```plaintext\nrunning, runner, runs, ran\n```\n\nWhen we apply stemming, they all get reduced to the root form:\n\n```plaintext\nrun\n```\n\nSo, \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" all become \"run\".\n\n### Why Do We Use Stemming in NLP?\n\n1. **Simplifies Text**: Stemming simplifies words to their root form, which makes it easier to analyze text. For instance, \"running\" and \"ran\" are different forms of the same concept, and stemming helps treat them as one.\n\n2. **Reduces Complexity**: By converting different forms of a word to a common base, stemming reduces the number of unique words in a text. This makes the analysis more manageable and less complex.\n\n3. **Improves Search Results**: In tasks like search engines or information retrieval, stemming helps find relevant documents by matching different word forms. For example, searching for \"run\" will also return results for \"running\" and \"ran\".\n\n4. **Consistent Analysis**: It ensures that variations of a word are consistently analyzed together, improving the accuracy of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\n\n### Example:\n\nIf you are building a program to understand customer reviews, you might have sentences like:\n\n```plaintext\nI enjoyed running in the park.\nShe runs every morning.\nHe is a fast runner.\nYesterday, I ran for an hour.\n```\n\nStemming will reduce \"running\", \"runs\", \"runner\", and \"ran\" to the common root \"run\". This way, your program understands that all these sentences are about the activity of running.\n\nStemming helps simplify and standardize words in text, making it easier for computers to analyze and understand different forms of words as part of the same concept.\n\n### What is a Stemmer?\n\nA stemmer is a tool in NLP that reduces words to their root form or base form. This helps in simplifying and standardizing words for easier analysis.\n\n### PorterStemmer:\n\n- **Developed by**: Martin Porter in 1980.\n- **Characteristics**: \n  - It's one of the oldest and most widely used stemming algorithms.\n  - It uses a set of rules to iteratively strip suffixes from words.\n  - Known for its simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Example**:\n  ```plaintext\n  \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\" -> \"run\"\n  ```\n\n### Snowball Stemmer:\n\n- **Developed by**: Martin Porter as well, it's an improvement over the original Porter Stemmer.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Also known as the Porter2 Stemmer.\n  - More aggressive and efficient compared to the original Porter Stemmer.\n  - Supports multiple languages, unlike the original Porter Stemmer which is English-only.\n- **Example**:\n  ```plaintext\n  \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\" -> \"run\"\n  ```\n\nBoth stemmers aim to reduce words to their root form, the Snowball Stemmer is a more advanced and versatile version of the original Porter Stemmer, supporting additional languages and more sophisticated stemming rules.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from nltk.stem.porter import

Each category in the dataset is transformed into a new binary column, where only one column is set to 1 (indicating the presence of the category), and all others are set to 0.\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nSuppose we have a dataset with a single categorical feature, \"Fruit\":\n\n| ID | Fruit    |\n|----|----------|\n| 1  | Apple    |\n| 2  | Banana   |\n| 3  | Orange   |\n| 4  | Banana   |\n| 5  | Apple    |\n\nAfter applying one-hot encoding, the dataset is transformed into:\n\n| ID | Fruit_Apple | Fruit_Banana | Fruit_Orange |\n|----|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1  | 1           | 0            | 0            |\n| 2  | 0           | 1            | 0            |\n| 3  | 0           | 0            | 1            |\n| 4  | 0           | 1            | 0            |\n| 5  | 1           | 0            | 0            |\n\n### Advantages of One-Hot Encoding\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.\n2. **No Ordinal Relationships**: Suitable for categorical variables where there is no ordinal relationship (no natural ordering).\n3. **Compatibility**: Works well with many machine learning algorithms, including linear models and neural networks.\n\n### Disadvantages of One-Hot Encoding\n\n1. **High Dimensionality**: Can lead to a large number of columns, especially if the categorical variable has many unique values.\n2. **Sparse Representation**: Results in sparse matrices, which can be memory inefficient.\n3. **Loss of Information**: Does not capture any inherent relationships between categories (e.g., similarity between \"Red\" and \"Pink\").\n4. **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV)**: Data refers to data that was not present in the training set and therefore not accounted for during the one-hot encoding process. When OOV data appears during the model's deployment or testing phase, it poses significant challenges.\n\n### Why Use One-Hot Encoding in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\nIn Natural Language Processing (NLP), one-hot encoding is often used to represent words or tokens as binary vectors. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Representation of Categorical Data**: Words are categorical data and need to be converted into a numerical form for machine learning models.\n2. **No Ordinal Relationship**: In many cases, there is no inherent order to words, making one-hot encoding appropriate.\n3. **Compatibility with Algorithms**: Many NLP algorithms and models (e.g., neural networks) can easily work with one-hot encoded vectors.\n4. **Baseline Representation**: One-hot encoding provides a simple baseline representation for more complex embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or contextual embeddings from transformer models.\n\n### Example in NLP\n\nConsider the sentence \"I love NLP\":\n\n| Word  | One-Hot Vector       |\n|-------|-----------------------|\n| I     | [1, 0, 0, 0]          |\n| love  | [0, 1, 0, 0]          |\n| NLP   | [0, 0, 1, 0]          |\n\nEach word is represented as a vector with a length equal to the number of unique words in the vocabulary, with a 1 indicating the presence of the word and 0s elsewhere.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOne-hot encoding is a fundamental technique in machine learning and NLP for handling categorical data. Despite its limitations, it serves as a simple and effective method for representing categorical features in a format suitable for various algorithms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.026130Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.026623Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.031481Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.026440Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.030519Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Apple']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.032620Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.032894Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.044818Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.032860Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.043827Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"execution_count":50,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   ID   Fruit\n0   1   Apple\n1   2  Banana\n2   3  Orange\n3   4  Banana\n4   5   Apple","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>ID</th>\n      <th>Fruit</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Orange</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"encoder = OneHotEncoder()\nencoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(df[['Fruit']])\nencoded_df = pd.DataFrame(encoded_data.toarray(), columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['Fruit']))\nfinal_df = pd.concat([df, encoded_df], axis=1)\nfinal_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.046082Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.046477Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.069471Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.046445Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-22T13:50:57.068613Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":51,"outputs":[{"execution_count":51,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   ID   Fruit  Fruit_Apple  Fruit_Banana  Fruit_Orange\n0   1   Apple          1.0           0.0           0.0\n1   2  Banana          0.0           1.0           0.0\n2   3  Orange          0.0           0.0           1.0\n3   4  Banana          0.0           1.0           0.0\n4   5   Apple          1.0           0.0           0.0","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>ID</th>\n      <th>Fruit</th>\n      <th>Fruit_Apple</th>\n      <th>Fruit_Banana</th>\n      <th>Fruit_Orange</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Orange</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Bag of Words\n</b></div>\n\n**Bag of Words (BoW)** is a simple and commonly used technique in natural language processing (NLP) for converting text data into numerical features. It represents text data by counting the occurrence of each word in the document, disregarding grammar and word order, but keeping multiplicity.\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nSuppose we have a small dataset with three sentences:\n\n1. \"I love apples\"\n2. \"I hate bananas\"\n3. \"I love oranges\"\n\nFirst, we create a vocabulary of all unique words in the dataset:\n\n| Word     | Index |\n|----------|-------|\n| I        | 1     |\n| love     | 2     |\n| apples   | 3     |\n| hate     | 4     |\n| bananas  | 5     |\n| oranges  | 6     |\n\nUsing this vocabulary, we can represent each sentence as a vector of word counts:\n\n| Sentence         | I | love | apples | hate | bananas | oranges |\n|------------------|---|------|--------|------|---------|---------|\n| \"I love apples\"  | 1 | 1    | 1      | 0    | 0       | 0       |\n| \"I hate bananas\" | 1 | 0    | 0      | 1    | 1       | 0       |\n| \"I love oranges\" | 1 | 1    | 0      | 0    | 0       | 1       |\n\n### Advantages of Bag of Words\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.\n2. **Direct Representation**: Directly represents the frequency of words in a document, making it straightforward to interpret.\n3. **Compatibility**: Works well with many traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n\n### Disadvantages of Bag of Words\n\n1. **High Dimensionality**: Can result in very large and sparse matrices, especially with large vocabularies.\n2. **No Context or Semantics**: Ignores the order of words and does not capture any semantic relationships between words.\n3. **Feature Independence**: Assumes independence between words, which is often not true in natural language.\n\n### Why Use Bag of Words in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\n1. **Baseline Model**: Provides a simple baseline for text representation, which can be used as a starting point before moving to more complex models.\n2. **Text Classification**: Effective for text classification tasks where the frequency of individual words is more important than their order or context.\n3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into a numerical format that machine learning models can process.\n\n### Core Intuition of Bag of Words\n\nThe core intuition behind Bag of Words is to treat text as a collection of individual words and to represent documents based on the frequency of each word in the document. The representation ignores the order and structure of words, focusing solely on their presence and count.\n\n### Formula\n\nLet \\( D \\) be a document containing words $( w_1, w_2, ..., w_n )$ from a vocabulary $(V)$.\n\nThe Bag of Words representation of $(D)$ can be defined as a vector $(\\mathbf{v}_D)$ where each element $(v_i)$ corresponds to the count of word $(w_i)$ in $(D)$:\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_D = [\\text{count}(w_1, D), \\text{count}(w_2, D), ..., \\text{count}(w_n, D)]$\n\nWhere $\\text{count}(w_i, D)$ is the number of times word $( w_i )$ appears in document $ D $.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the same sentences:\n\n1. \"I love apples\"\n2. \"I hate bananas\"\n3. \"I love oranges\"\n\nVocabulary: {I, love, apples, hate, bananas, oranges}\n\nFor \"I love apples\":\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{D1} = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]$\n\nFor \"I hate bananas\":\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{D2} = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]$\n\nFor \"I love oranges\":\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{D3} = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBag of Words is a fundamental technique in NLP for converting text into numerical features. While it has limitations like ignoring word order and context, its simplicity and effectiveness make it a useful starting point for many text processing and machine learning tasks.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'Text': [\n        'I love apples',\n        'I hate bananas',\n        'I love oranges',\n        'I love mango'\n    ],\n

items (words, characters, etc.) from a given text or speech. They are used in NLP to capture the context of words by considering the surrounding words in a text.\n\n### Types of N-grams\n\n1. **Unigrams**: Single words (n=1)\n2. **Bigrams**: Pairs of consecutive words (n=2)\n3. **Trigrams**: Triples of consecutive words (n=3)\n4. **N-grams**: General form for sequences of n words\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nConsider the sentence: \"I love natural language processing\"\n\n**Unigrams** (n=1):\n\n| Unigram |\n|---------|\n| I       |\n| love    |\n| natural |\n| language|\n| processing |\n\n**Bigrams** (n=2):\n\n| Bigram                |\n|-----------------------|\n| I love                |\n| love natural          |\n| natural language      |\n| language processing   |\n\n**Trigrams** (n=3):\n\n| Trigram                     |\n|-----------------------------|\n| I love natural              |\n| love natural language       |\n| natural language processing |\n\n### Advantages of N-grams\n\n1. **Contextual Representation**: Bigrams and trigrams capture more context than unigrams by considering adjacent words.\n2. **Flexibility**: N-grams can be adjusted to capture different levels of context by changing the value of n.\n3. **Improved Performance**: Including bigrams and trigrams can improve the performance of models, especially in tasks like text classification and language modeling.\n\n### Disadvantages of N-grams\n\n1. **Data Sparsity**: As n increases, the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially, leading to sparse data issues.\n2. **Memory and Computation**: Higher-order n-grams require more memory and computational power to process and store.\n3. **Limited Long-range Context**: N-grams capture only a limited context and may miss long-range dependencies in the text.\n\n### Why Use N-grams in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\n1. **Context Preservation**: Unlike unigrams, bigrams and trigrams can preserve some word order and context information, which is crucial for many NLP tasks.\n2. **Feature Enrichment**: Using n-grams enriches the feature set for machine learning models, potentially leading to better performance.\n3. **Language Models**: N-grams are foundational in building statistical language models to predict the next word in a sequence.\n\n### Core Intuition of N-grams\n\nThe core intuition behind n-grams is to capture local context by considering contiguous sequences of words. This helps in understanding the syntactic and semantic relationships between words, improving the model's ability to process natural language.\n\n### Formula\n\nFor a given sequence of words $(S)$ = $([w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_m])$:\n\n1. **Unigram**: $(S)$ itself as $([w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_m])$\n2. **Bigram**: $((w_1, w_2), (w_2, w_3), \\ldots, (w_{m-1}, w_m))$\n3. **Trigram**: $((w_1, w_2, w_3), (w_2, w_3, w_4), \\ldots, (w_{m-2}, w_{m-1}, w_m))$\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the same sentence: \"I love natural language processing\"\n\n**Unigrams**:\n\n$ S_{uni} = [I, love, natural, language, processing] $\n\n**Bigrams**:\n\n$ S_{bi} = [(I, love), (love, natural), (natural, language), (language, processing)] $\n\n**Trigrams**:\n\n$ S_{tri} = [(I, love, natural), (love, natural, language), (natural, language, processing)] $\n\n### Conclusion\n\nN-grams are a fundamental concept in NLP for capturing the local context of words in a text. By considering sequences of words, n-grams help in preserving some syntactic and semantic relationships, making them useful for various NLP tasks such as text classification, language modeling, and feature extraction. Despite their limitations, n-grams provide a simple yet powerful way to enhance text representation and improve model performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'Text':

Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It combines two metrics: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).\n\n- **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. It is often normalized to prevent bias towards longer documents.\n- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how important a term is. It decreases the weight of terms that appear frequently in many documents and increases the weight of terms that appear in a few documents.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a corpus with three documents:\n\n1. \"I love apples\"\n2. \"I love bananas\"\n3. \"I love apples and bananas\"\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Term Frequency (TF)\n\n$$\n\\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d}\n$$\n\n| Document | Term     | TF      |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| D1       | I        | 1/3     |\n| D1       | love     | 1/3     |\n| D1       | apples   | 1/3     |\n| D2       | I        | 1/3     |\n| D2       | love     | 1/3     |\n| D2       | bananas  | 1/3     |\n| D3       | I        | 1/5     |\n| D3       | love     | 1/5     |\n| D3       | apples   | 1/5     |\n| D3       | and      | 1/5     |\n| D3       | bananas  | 1/5     |\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\n$$\n\\text{IDF}(t) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents}}{\\text{Number of documents containing term } t}\\right)\n$$\n\nIDF is calculated using the formula:\n$text{IDF}(t) = \\log \\left(\\frac{N}{df(t)}\\right) $\nwhere $ N $ is the total number of documents, and $ df(t) $ is the number of documents containing the term $ t $.\n\n| Term    | df(t) | IDF       |\n|---------|-------|-----------|\n| I       | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| love    | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| apples  | 2     | log(3/2) = 0.176|\n| bananas | 2     | log(3/2) = 0.176|\n| and     | 1     | log(3/1) = 0.477|\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate TF-IDF\n\nTF-IDF is calculated by multiplying TF and IDF for each term in each document.\n\n| Document | Term     | TF      | IDF       | TF-IDF        |\n|----------|----------|---------|-----------|---------------|\n| D1       | I        | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D1       | love     | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D1       | apples   | 1/3     | 0.176     | 0.059         |\n| D2       | I        | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D2       | love     | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D2       | bananas  | 1/3     | 0.176     | 0.059         |\n| D3       | I        | 1/5     | 0         | 0             |\n| D3       | love     | 1/5     | 0         | 0             |\n| D3       | apples   | 1/5     | 0.176     | 0.035         |\n| D3       | and      | 1/5     | 0.477     | 0.095         |\n| D3       | bananas  | 1/5     | 0.176     | 0.035         |\n\n### Advantages of TF-IDF\n\n1. **Simple to Understand**: TF-IDF is easy to compute and understand.\n2. **Effective**: Often effective for text representation in various NLP tasks like text classification and information retrieval.\n3. **Reduces Noise**: By reducing the weight of common terms, it helps in emphasizing more informative words.\n\n### Disadvantages of TF-IDF\n\n1. **High Dimensionality**: Like Bag of Words, it can result in high-dimensional feature vectors.\n2. **Context Ignorance**: Does not capture the semantic meaning or context of words.\n3. **Static Nature**: Needs to be recomputed if the corpus changes, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n\n### Why Use TF-IDF in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\n1. **Feature Weighting**: Provides a way to weight features based on their importance, making it useful for text mining and information retrieval.\n2. **Information Retrieval**: Helps in ranking documents based on relevance to a query by giving higher weight to rare but important terms.\n3. **Text Classification**: Enhances the performance of classifiers by focusing on significant words and ignoring common words that carry less information.\n\n### Core Intuition of TF-IDF\n\nThe core intuition behind TF-IDF is to assign higher weights to words that are important in a particular document but not common across the entire corpus. This helps in distinguishing documents based on their unique terms.\n\n### TF-IDF Formula\n\nThe TF-IDF value for a term $ t $ in a document $ d $ is calculated as:\n\n$ \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t) $\n\nwhere:\n- $ \\text{TF}(t, d) $ is the term frequency of $ t $ in document $ d $.\n- $ \\text{IDF}(t) $ is the inverse document frequency of term $ t $.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the sentence \"I love apples\":\n\n1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: \n\n| Term   | TF (raw count) | TF (normalized) |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------|\n| I      | 1              | 1/3             |\n| love   | 1              | 1/3             |\n| apples | 1              | 1/3             |\n\n2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:\n\n| Term   | df(t) | IDF                  |\n|--------|-------|----------------------|\n| I      | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| love   | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| apples | 2     | log(3/2) = 0.176|\n\n3. **TF-IDF Calculation**:\n\n| Term   | TF (normalized) | IDF      | TF-IDF       |\n|--------|-----------------|----------|--------------|\n| I      | 1/3             | 0        | 0            |\n| love   | 1/3             | 0        | 0            |\n| apples | 1/3             | 0.176    | 0.059        |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTF-IDF is a powerful technique for text feature extraction, offering a way to weigh terms by their importance in a document relative to a corpus. It reduces the influence of common terms and highlights unique terms, improving the effectiveness of information retrieval and text classification tasks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'Text': [\n        'I love apples',\n        'I hate bananas',\n        'I love oranges',\n        'I love mango'\n    ],\n

style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Word Embedding\n</b></div>\n\nWord embedding is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to represent words as vectors of real numbers in a continuous vector space. This representation allows words with similar meanings to have similar representations, which makes it easier for machine learning models to process and understand text data. \n\n### Key Points about Word Embeddings:\n\n1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Instead of representing words as sparse vectors (like in one-hot encoding), word embeddings represent words in a lower-dimensional space, capturing the semantic relationships between words.\n\n2. **Contextual Meaning**: Words with similar meanings or words that often appear in similar contexts have vectors that are close together in the embedding space.\n\n3. **Applications**:\n   - **Text Classification**: Word embeddings can be used to convert text into numerical features for machine learning models.\n   - **Machine Translation**: By understanding the semantic meaning of words, word embeddings can improve the quality of translations.\n   - **Sentiment Analysis**: They help in capturing the sentiment of words in context.\n   - **Information Retrieval**: Word embeddings can improve search results by understanding the meaning behind search queries.\n\n### Example:\n\nSuppose we have the following sentences:\n\n1. \"The cat sits on the mat.\"\n2. \"The dog lies on the rug.\"\n\nIn a word embedding space, the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" would be represented by vectors that are close to each other, as they both represent animals. Similarly, \"mat\" and \"rug\" would have similar vectors, representing objects that one can lie or sit on.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Word2Vec\n</b></div>\n\n### What is Word2Vec?\n\nWord2Vec is a popular word embedding technique developed by Google that uses neural networks to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. It represents words as vectors in a continuous vector space, where words with similar contexts have similar vector representations. There are two main models within Word2Vec:\n\n1. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**: Predicts the target word (center word) from the context words (surrounding words).\n2. **Skip-gram**: Predicts the context words from the target word.\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nLet's use a simple dataset consisting of three sentences:\n\n1. \"I love dogs\"\n2. \"Dogs are awesome\"\n3. \"I love cats\"\n\nWe'll create a vocabulary and show how Word2Vec generates embeddings. For simplicity, we'll use the Skip-gram model.\n\n#### Vocabulary:\n- I\n- love\n- dogs\n- are\n- awesome\n- cats\n\n#### Training Data for Skip-gram (window size = 1):\n\n| Center Word | Context Word |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| I           | love         |\n| love        | I            |\n| love        | dogs         |\n| dogs        | love         |\n| Dogs        | are          |\n| are         | Dogs         |\n| are         | awesome      |\n| awesome     | are          |\n| I           | love         |\n| love        | I            |\n| love        | cats         |\n| cats        | love         |\n\n#### Word Embeddings:\nAfter training, Word2Vec generates embeddings (vectors) for each word. For simplicity, let's assume the vectors are of 2 dimensions.\n\n| Word    | Embedding      |\n|---------|----------------|\n| I       | [0.4, 0.1]     |\n| love    | [0.5, 0.2]     |\n| dogs    | [0.6, 0.3]     |\n| are     | [0.3, 0.4]     |\n| awesome | [0.2, 0.5]     |\n| cats    | [0.7, 0.6]     |\n\n### Why Do We Need Word2Vec?\n\n1. **Semantic Meaning**: Captures semantic relationships between words, making it useful for tasks like similarity measurement and sentiment analysis.\n2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the high dimensionality of text data while preserving important information.\n3. **Improved Performance**: Enhances the performance of machine learning models by providing better word representations.\n4. **Contextual Understanding**: Understands the context in which words are used, allowing for more accurate natural language understanding.\n\n### Differences from Other Word Embeddings\n\n#### Bag of Words (BoW)\n- **Representation**: Represents text as a vector of word counts or frequencies.\n- **Dimensionality**: High dimensionality (number of unique words in the corpus).\n- **Context**: Ignores the order of words and their context.\n- **Example**: For the sentence \"I love dogs\", the BoW vector might be [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n#### Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)\n- **Representation**: Represents text as a vector of weighted word counts, where weights are determined by the frequency of words in the document and the inverse frequency of words in the entire corpus.\n- **Dimensionality**: High dimensionality, similar to BoW.\n- **Context**: Ignores the order of words and their context, but adjusts for common versus rare words.\n- **Example**: For the sentence \"I love dogs\", the TF-IDF vector might be [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0, 0, 0] (weights depend on the corpus).\n\n#### Word2Vec\n- **Representation**: Represents words as dense vectors in a continuous space.\n- **Dimensionality**: Lower dimensionality, typically 100-300 dimensions.\n- **Context**: Captures context and semantic meaning by predicting words from their surroundings.\n- **Example**: For the word \"love\", the Word2Vec vector might be [0.5, 0.2].\n\n### Underlying Assumption\n\nThe underlying assumption of Word2Vec is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. This is based on the distributional hypothesis in linguistics, which suggests that words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings. Word2Vec leverages this hypothesis by learning vector representations of words in such a way that words with similar contexts in the training corpus have similar vector representations.\n\n### Summary\n\n| Feature        | BoW                      | TF-IDF                   | Word2Vec                |\n|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Dimensionality | High                     | High                     | Low                     |\n| Context        | No                       | No                       | Yes                     |\n| Semantic Meaning | No                       | Partially                | Yes                     |\n| Representation | Sparse vectors (counts)  | Sparse vectors (weights) | Dense vectors (embeddings) |\n\nWord2Vec provides a more meaningful and context-aware representation of words compared to BoW and TF-IDF, making it a powerful tool for various NLP tasks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Types of Word2Vec\n</b></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:20px;\">\n    <img src=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216636.g001&type=large\" alt=\"NLP Pipeline\" style=\"width:80%; border-radius:10px;\"/>\n    <p style=\"font-size:14px; color:#555;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Word2Vec-architecture-The-figure-shows-two-variants-of-word2vec-architecture-CBOW-and_fig1_339921386\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#555;\">ResearchGate</a></p>\n</div>\n\n### CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)\n\n#### CBOW is a model used in natural language processing (NLP) to learn word embeddings from a corpus of text. It aims to predict the target word (center word) based on its surrounding context words. Let's delve into how CBOW works and its applications.\n\n### Understanding CBOW\n\nCBOW operates by predicting a target word given its context words. It treats this prediction task as a supervised learning problem, where the input is the context words and the output is the target word.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nConsider the following text snippet and let's select a window size of 3 for simplicity:\n\n**Text:**\n\"Use kaggle for data science\"\n\nFor a window size of 3, we generate training pairs:\n\n1. Window 1: Context words = [\"Use\", \"for\"], Target word = \"kaggle\"\n2. Window 2: Context words = [\"kaggle\", \"data\"], Target word = \"for\"\n3. Window 3: Context words = [\"for\", \"science\"], Target word = \"data\"\n\n### Data Preparation\n\nAfter selecting context and target pairs, we convert the context words into a one-hot encoded vector representation:\n\n\n| Context (X)         | Target (Y) |\n|---------------------|------------|\n| `[1 0 0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0 0 0]` | kaggle     |\n| `[0 1 0 0 0 0] [0 0 1 0 0 0]` | for        |\n| `[0 0 1 0 0 0] [0 0 0 1 0 0]` | data       |\n\n\n\n\n### Training the Neural Network\n\nWe feed these pairs into a neural network where the input is the one-hot encoded context vector and the output is the target word. The network learns to predict the target word based on the context words.\n\n### Skipgram\n\n\n#### In contrast to CBOW, the Skipgram model predicts context words from a given target word. It reverses the CBOW approach, aiming to predict the context words surrounding a target word. Skipgram is beneficial when dealing with larger datasets but requires more computational resources compared to CBOW.\n\n| Target (Y) | Context (X)                   |\n|------------|-------------------------------|\n| kaggle     | `[1 0 0 0 0 0] [0 1 0 0 0 0]`  |\n| for        | `[0 1 0 0 0 0] [0 0 1 0 0 0]`  |\n| data       | `[0 0 1 0 0 0] [0 0 0 1 0 0]`  |\n\n\n### Improving Word2Vec Performance\n\nTo enhance Word2Vec performance:\n- **Increase Training Data**: Use larger datasets to train the model more effectively.\n- **Increase Vector Dimensions**: Higher-dimensional embeddings capture more semantic nuances but require more computational resources.\n- **Expand Context Window**: Enlarging the context window captures broader semantic relationships but increases training time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCBOW provides an efficient method for learning word embeddings by predicting a target word from its context. It is suitable for smaller datasets due to its faster training time compared to Skipgram. By optimizing parameters like training data size, vector dimensions, and context window, CBOW can be tailored to specific NLP tasks, enhancing its effectiveness in various applications such as text classification and information retrieval.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px;

Explanation of Parameters:\n\n1. **`gensim.models.Word2Vec`**:\n   - This is the Word2Vec class from the `gensim` library, which is used to create and train Word2Vec models.\n\n2. **`window=10`**:\n   - The `window` parameter defines the maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence.\n   - For example, if `window=10`, the model will consider up to 10 words to the left and 10 words to the right of the target word to predict the context words.\n   - This allows the model to learn relationships between words that are up to 10 words apart, providing a wider context for each word.\n\n3. **`min_count=2`**:\n   - The `min_count` parameter sets the minimum number of occurrences of a word for it to be included in the Word2Vec model.\n   - Words that appear fewer times than this threshold are ignored and not included in the training process.\n   - Setting `min_count=2` ensures that only words that appear at least twice in the corpus are considered, which helps to reduce noise by ignoring rare words.\n\n4. **`workers=4`**:\n   - The `workers` parameter specifies the number of worker threads to use for training the model.\n   - Using multiple threads can speed up the training process by parallelizing it.\n   - Setting `workers=4` means that 4 threads will be used for training the model, making it faster than using a single

This involves training a model to identify the category a given piece of text belongs to based on its content. Common applications include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.\n\n### Types\n\nText classification can be categorized into several types based on the nature and number of labels assigned to each text:\n\n1. **Binary Classification**:\n   - Classifies text into one of two possible categories.\n   - Example: Spam vs. Not Spam.\n\n2. **Multiclass Classification**:\n   - Classifies text into one of more than two possible categories.\n   - Example: Classifying news articles into categories like Sports, Politics, Technology, etc.\n\n3. **Multilabel Classification**:\n   - Assigns multiple labels to a single text.\n   - Example: Tagging a movie review with labels like Action, Adventure, and Comedy.\n\n4. **Hierarchical Classification**:\n   - Classifies text into a hierarchy of categories, where categories can have subcategories.\n   - Example: Classifying documents first into broad categories like Science, and then into narrower subcategories like Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.\n\n### Applications\n\nEach type serves different purposes and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.\n\nText classification has numerous applications across various domains. Here are some key applications:\n\n1. **Spam Detection**:\n   - Automatically identifying and filtering out spam emails from a user's inbox.\n\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n   - Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a piece of text, such as reviews, social media posts, or customer feedback.\n\n3. **Topic Categorization**:\n   - Classifying news articles, blog posts, or documents into predefined topics or categories, such as sports, politics, technology, etc.\n\n4. **Language Detection**:\n   - Identifying the language in which a piece of text is written.\n\n5. **Document Organization**:\n   - Automatically organizing and tagging documents in large datasets, such as legal documents, research papers, or customer service tickets.\n\n6. **Customer Support Automation**:\n   - Routing customer queries to the appropriate department based on the content of the query.\n\n7. **Product Recommendation**:\n   - Categorizing products based on customer reviews to recommend similar products.\n\n8. **Fraud Detection**:\n   - Identifying fraudulent activities or transactions by analyzing text data.\n\n9. **Content Moderation**:\n   - Automatically detecting and filtering inappropriate or harmful content in social media, forums, or online communities.\n\n10. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**:\n    - Understanding and classifying user intents to provide appropriate responses.\n\n11. **Information Retrieval**:\n    - Enhancing search engines by categorizing and tagging content for more accurate and relevant search results.\n\nThese applications showcase the versatility and importance of text classification in various industries and everyday applications.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center;

The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.<br /><br />It's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn't still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success.

(Part-of-Speech) tagging is the process of assigning a part-of-speech label to each word in a sentence. These labels include categories such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and others. The process involves both lexical analysis (identifying words) and syntactic analysis (assigning POS tags based on context and grammar rules).\n\n### Example:\n\nGiven the sentence:\n- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\nPOS tagging would output:\n- The/DT quick/JJ brown/JJ fox/NN jumps/VBZ over/IN the/DT lazy/JJ dog/NN\n\nHere, DT stands for determiner, JJ for adjective, NN for noun, VBZ for verb (third person singular present), and IN for preposition.\n\n### Applications of POS Tagging:\n\n1. **Text Preprocessing**:\n   - Used as a step in text preprocessing to prepare data for further NLP tasks such as parsing, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.\n\n2. **Information Retrieval**:\n   - Helps improve the performance of search engines by understanding the role of each word in a query, which can enhance search accuracy and relevance.\n\n3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:\n   - Assists in identifying and classifying proper nouns, such as names of people, organizations, and locations.\n\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n   - Enhances sentiment analysis by understanding the role of adjectives, adverbs, and verbs, which are crucial for determining sentiment.\n\n5. **Machine Translation**:\n   - Helps in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences, which is essential for accurately translating text from one language to another.\n\n6. **Speech Recognition**:\n   - Aids in transcribing spoken language into written text by correctly identifying the part of speech for each word, improving the accuracy of the transcription.\n\n7. **Grammar Checking**:\n   - Used in grammar checkers to identify and correct grammatical errors by analyzing the syntactic structure of sentences.\n\n8. **Question Answering Systems**:\n   - Enhances the ability of QA systems to understand and generate responses by correctly interpreting the syntactic roles of words in both questions and answers.\n\n9. **Text-to-Speech Systems**:\n   - Improves the naturalness of synthesized speech by providing accurate prosody and intonation patterns based on the parts of speech.\n\n10. **Coreference Resolution**:\n    - Helps in identifying and resolving references to the same entities within a text, which is crucial for tasks that require understanding the relationships between different parts of the text.\n\nPOS tagging is a fundamental task in NLP that supports and enhances various advanced language processing applications, making it a critical component in the field.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Viterbi Algorithm for POS Tagging\n</b></div>\n\n### Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in POS Tagging\n\nA Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that is particularly useful for sequence labeling tasks like Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. An HMM models the sequence of tags and words with two key assumptions:\n\n1. **Markov Assumption**: The probability of a tag depends only on the previous tag.\n2. **Output Independence Assumption**: The probability of a word depends only on the current tag.\n\nAn HMM for POS tagging consists of:\n- **States**: Represent the POS tags.\n- **Observations**: Represent the words in the sentence.\n- **Transition Probabilities (A)**: Probability of moving from one state (tag) to another state (tag).\n- **Emission Probabilities (B)**: Probability of observing a word given a state (tag).\n- **Initial Probabilities (π)**: Probability of starting in each state (tag).\n\n### HMM Parameters\n- **A (Transition probabilities)**: \\( P(t_i | t_{i-1}) \\)\n- **B (Emission probabilities)**: \\( P(w_i | t_i) \\)\n- **π (Initial probabilities)**: \\( P(t_1) \\)\n\n### Viterbi Algorithm in POS Tagging\n\nThe Viterbi algorithm is a method used in POS tagging to find the most probable sequence of tags for a sentence. It does this by tracking the best paths and their probabilities for each word, ensuring efficient computation of the optimal tag sequence.\n\n### Steps of the Viterbi Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - $ v_1(k) = \\pi_k \\cdot B_k(o_1) $\n   - Here, $ v_1(k) $ is the probability of the most likely path ending in state $(k)$ at step 1.\n\n2. **Recursion**:\n   - For each time step $ t $ from 2 to $ T $:\n     - $ v_t(k) = \\max_{j} \\left[ v_{t-1}(j) \\cdot A_{jk} \\right] \\cdot B_k(o_t) $\n     - Track the state $ j $ that maximizes $ v_t(k) $.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   - Find the maximum probability of the final states:\n     - $ P^* = \\max_{k} \\left[ v_T(k) \\right] $\n   - Backtrack to find the optimal path.\n\n### Example\n\nGiven a simple sentence and an HMM, let's illustrate the process.\n\n#### Sentence: \"The cat sleeps\"\n\n#### Tags: $ T = \\{DT, NN, VB\\} $\n\n#### Words: $ W = \\{The, cat, sleeps\\} $\n\n#### Transition Probabilities (A):\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\nP(DT|DT) & P(NN|DT) & P(VB|DT) \\\\\nP(DT|NN) & P(NN|NN) & P(VB|NN) \\\\\nP(DT|VB) & P(NN|VB) & P(VB|VB)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n#### Emission Probabilities (B):\n$$\nB = \\begin{bmatrix}\nP(The|DT) & P(cat|DT) & P(sleeps|DT) \\\\\nP(The|NN) & P(cat|NN) & P(sleeps|NN) \\\\\nP(The|VB) & P(cat|VB) & P(sleeps|VB)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n#### Initial Probabilities (π):\n\\[\nπ = \\{ P(DT), P(NN), P(VB) \\}\n\\]\n\n#### Viterbi Algorithm Execution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   $$\n   v_1(DT) = π(DT) \\cdot B_{DT}(The)\n   $$\n   $$\n   v_1(NN) = π(NN) \\cdot B_{NN}(The)\n   $$\n   $$\n   v_1(VB) = π(VB) \\cdot B_{VB}(The)\n   $$\n\n2. **Recursion**:\n   $$\n   v_2(NN) = \\max \\left[ v_1(DT) \\cdot A_{DT,NN}, v_1(NN) \\cdot A_{NN,NN}, v_1(VB) \\cdot A_{VB,NN} \\right] \\cdot B_{NN}(cat)\n   $$\n   Repeat for all words and states.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   $$\n   P^* = \\max \\left[ v_3(DT), v_3(NN), v_3(VB) \\right]\n   $$\n   Backtrack to find the optimal tag sequence.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **HMM**: Models the sequence of POS tags and words using transition and emission probabilities.\n- **Viterbi Algorithm**: Finds the most likely sequence of POS tags for a given sentence using dynamic programming.\n\nThis combination of HMMs and the Viterbi algorithm provides a powerful method for POS tagging, efficiently handling the complexities of natural language.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a>\n# <div style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#ebbf21; padding:10px; border-radius:10px; color:black; font-family:'Georgia', serif;\"><b>Example of POS Tagging Using HMM and Viterbi Algorithm with Custom Dataset\n</b></div>\n\nSuppose we have a dataset with parts of speech: Verb (V), Noun (N), and Adjective (A).\n\n| Docs                       |\n|----------------------------|\n| Sarah enjoys reading       |\n| Can Sarah read books       |\n| Will John read books       |\n| John enjoys sports         |\n| Sarah loves sports         |\n\nIn the first step, we need to label each word in the dataset with its part of speech.
