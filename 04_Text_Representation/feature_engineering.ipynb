These tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the application. Think of it like cutting a paragraph into smaller, manageable parts.\n\n#### Example:\n\nImagine you have this sentence:\n\n```plaintext\nI love eating pizza!\n```\n\nWhen we tokenize it into words, it becomes:\n\n```plaintext\n[\"I\", \"love\", \"eating\", \"pizza\", \"!\"]\n```\n\nEach word and punctuation mark becomes a separate token.\n\n#### Why Do We Use Tokenization in NLP?\n\n1. **Easier Analysis**: Breaking text into tokens makes it easier to analyze. It's like reading a book one word at a time instead of trying to understand it all at once.\n   \n2. **Understanding Context**: It helps in understanding the context of each word in a sentence. For example, knowing that \"love\" is followed by \"eating\" gives a clear picture of the meaning.\n\n3. **Efficient Processing**: Computers can process and analyze tokens more efficiently than long strings of text. It speeds up tasks like searching for specific words or understanding the structure of sentences.\n\n4. **Building Blocks for NLP Tasks**: Tokenization is the first step for many NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and text summarization. It prepares the text for more complex processing.\n\nTokenization helps break down text into smaller, understandable parts, making it easier for computers to analyze and work with.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

It's like finding the \"stem\" of a word, which can help us understand different variations of the same word.\n\n#### Example:\n\nImagine you have these words:\n\n```plaintext\nrunning, runner, runs, ran\n```\n\nWhen we apply stemming, they all get reduced to the root form:\n\n```plaintext\nrun\n```\n\nSo, \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" all become \"run\".\n\n#### Why Do We Use Stemming in NLP?\n\n1. **Simplifies Text**: Stemming simplifies words to their root form, which makes it easier to analyze text. For instance, \"running\" and \"ran\" are different forms of the same concept, and stemming helps treat them as one.\n\n2. **Reduces Complexity**: By converting different forms of a word to a common base, stemming reduces the number of unique words in a text. This makes the analysis more manageable and less complex.\n\n3. **Improves Search Results**: In tasks like search engines or information retrieval, stemming helps find relevant documents by matching different word forms. For example, searching for \"run\" will also return results for \"running\" and \"ran\".\n\n4. **Consistent Analysis**: It ensures that variations of a word are consistently analyzed together, improving the accuracy of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\n\n#### Example:\n\nIf you are building a program to understand customer reviews, you might have sentences like:\n\n```plaintext\nI enjoyed running in the park.\nShe runs every morning.\nHe is a fast runner.\nYesterday, I ran for an hour.\n```\n\nStemming will reduce \"running\", \"runs\", \"runner\", and \"ran\" to the common root \"run\". This way, your program understands that all these sentences are about the activity of running.\n\nStemming helps simplify and standardize words in text, making it easier for computers to analyze and understand different forms of words as part of the same concept.\n\n### What is a Stemmer?\n\nA stemmer is a tool in NLP that reduces words to their root form or base form. This helps in simplifying and standardizing words for easier analysis.\n\n### PorterStemmer:\n\n- **Developed by**: Martin Porter in 1980.\n- **Characteristics**: \n  - It's one of the oldest and most widely used stemming algorithms.\n  - It uses a set of rules to iteratively strip suffixes from words.\n  - Known for its simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Example**:\n  ```plaintext\n  \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\" -> \"run\"\n  ```\n\n### Snowball Stemmer:\n\n- **Developed by**: Martin Porter as well, it's an improvement over the original Porter Stemmer.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Also known as the Porter2 Stemmer.\n  - More aggressive and efficient compared to the original Porter Stemmer.\n  - Supports multiple languages, unlike the original Porter Stemmer which is English-only.\n- **Example**:\n  ```plaintext\n  \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\" -> \"run\"\n  ```\n\nBoth stemmers aim to reduce words to their root form, the Snowball Stemmer is a more advanced and versatile version of the original Porter Stemmer, supporting additional languages and more sophisticated stemming rules.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from nltk.stem.porter import

Each category in the dataset is transformed into a new binary column, where only one column is set to 1 (indicating the presence of the category), and all others are set to 0.\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nSuppose we have a dataset with a single categorical feature, \"Fruit\":\n\n| ID | Fruit    |\n|----|----------|\n| 1  | Apple    |\n| 2  | Banana   |\n| 3  | Orange   |\n| 4  | Banana   |\n| 5  | Apple    |\n\nAfter applying one-hot encoding, the dataset is transformed into:\n\n| ID | Fruit_Apple | Fruit_Banana | Fruit_Orange |\n|----|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1  | 1           | 0            | 0            |\n| 2  | 0           | 1            | 0            |\n| 3  | 0           | 0            | 1            |\n| 4  | 0           | 1            | 0            |\n| 5  | 1           | 0            | 0            |\n\n### Advantages of One-Hot Encoding\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.\n2. **No Ordinal Relationships**: Suitable for categorical variables where there is no ordinal relationship (no natural ordering).\n3. **Compatibility**: Works well with many machine learning algorithms, including linear models and neural networks.\n\n### Disadvantages of One-Hot Encoding\n\n1. **High Dimensionality**: Can lead to a large number of columns, especially if the categorical variable has many unique values.\n2. **Sparse Representation**: Results in sparse matrices, which can be memory inefficient.\n3. **Loss of Information**: Does not capture any inherent relationships between categories (e.g., similarity between \"Red\" and \"Pink\").\n4. **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV)**: Data refers to data that was not present in the training set and therefore not accounted for during the one-hot encoding process. When OOV data appears during the model's deployment or testing phase, it poses significant challenges.\n\n### Why Use One-Hot Encoding in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\nIn Natural Language Processing (NLP), one-hot encoding is often used to represent words or tokens as binary vectors. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Representation of Categorical Data**: Words are categorical data and need to be converted into a numerical form for machine learning models.\n2. **No Ordinal Relationship**: In many cases, there is no inherent order to words, making one-hot encoding appropriate.\n3. **Compatibility with Algorithms**: Many NLP algorithms and models (e.g., neural networks) can easily work with one-hot encoded vectors.\n4. **Baseline Representation**: One-hot encoding provides a simple baseline representation for more complex embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or contextual embeddings from transformer models.\n\n### Example in NLP\n\nConsider the sentence \"I love NLP\":\n\n| Word  | One-Hot Vector       |\n|-------|-----------------------|\n| I     | [1, 0, 0, 0]          |\n| love  | [0, 1, 0, 0]          |\n| NLP   | [0, 0, 1, 0]          |\n\nEach word is represented as a vector with a length equal to the number of unique words in the vocabulary, with a 1 indicating the presence of the word and 0s elsewhere.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOne-hot encoding is a fundamental technique in machine learning and NLP for handling categorical data. Despite its limitations, it serves as a simple and effective method for representing categorical features in a format suitable for various algorithms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.237450Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.237816Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.242629Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.237778Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.241559Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Apple']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.244040Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.244386Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.262454Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.244357Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.261212Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"execution_count":50,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   ID   Fruit\n0   1   Apple\n1   2  Banana\n2   3  Orange\n3   4  Banana\n4   5   Apple","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>ID</th>\n      <th>Fruit</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Orange</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"encoder = OneHotEncoder()\nencoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(df[['Fruit']])\nencoded_df = pd.DataFrame(encoded_data.toarray(), columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['Fruit']))\nfinal_df = pd.concat([df, encoded_df], axis=1)\nfinal_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.263816Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.264210Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.291425Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.264150Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-19T20:48:37.290138Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":51,"outputs":[{"execution_count":51,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   ID   Fruit  Fruit_Apple  Fruit_Banana  Fruit_Orange\n0   1   Apple          1.0           0.0           0.0\n1   2  Banana          0.0           1.0           0.0\n2   3  Orange          0.0           0.0           1.0\n3   4  Banana          0.0           1.0           0.0\n4   5   Apple          1.0           0.0           0.0","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>ID</th>\n      <th>Fruit</th>\n      <th>Fruit_Apple</th>\n      <th>Fruit_Banana</th>\n      <th>Fruit_Orange</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Orange</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Banana</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Apple</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Bag of Words\n\n**Bag of Words (BoW)** is a simple and commonly used technique in natural language processing (NLP) for converting text data into numerical features. It represents text data by counting the occurrence of each word in the document, disregarding grammar and word order, but keeping multiplicity.\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nSuppose we have a small dataset with three sentences:\n\n1. \"I love apples\"\n2. \"I hate bananas\"\n3. \"I love oranges\"\n\nFirst, we create a vocabulary of all unique words in the dataset:\n\n| Word     | Index |\n|----------|-------|\n| I        | 1     |\n| love     | 2     |\n| apples   | 3     |\n| hate     | 4     |\n| bananas  | 5     |\n| oranges  | 6     |\n\nUsing this vocabulary, we can represent each sentence as a vector of word counts:\n\n| Sentence         | I | love | apples | hate | bananas | oranges |\n|------------------|---|------|--------|------|---------|---------|\n| \"I love apples\"  | 1 | 1    | 1      | 0    | 0       | 0       |\n| \"I hate bananas\" | 1 | 0    | 0      | 1    | 1       | 0       |\n| \"I love oranges\" | 1 | 1    | 0      | 0    | 0       | 1       |\n\n### Advantages of Bag of Words\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.\n2. **Direct Representation**: Directly represents the frequency of words in a document, making it straightforward to interpret.\n3. **Compatibility**: Works well with many traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n\n### Disadvantages of Bag of Words\n\n1. **High Dimensionality**: Can result in very large and sparse matrices, especially with large vocabularies.\n2. **No Context or Semantics**: Ignores the order of words and does not capture any semantic relationships between words.\n3. **Feature Independence**: Assumes independence between words, which is often not true in natural language.\n\n### Why Use Bag of Words in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\n1. **Baseline Model**: Provides a simple baseline for text representation, which can be used as a starting point before moving to more complex models.\n2. **Text Classification**: Effective for text classification tasks where the frequency of individual words is more important than their order or context.\n3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into a numerical format that machine learning models can process.\n\n### Core Intuition of Bag of Words\n\nThe core intuition behind Bag of Words is to treat text as a collection of individual words and to represent documents based on the frequency of each word in the document. The representation ignores the order and structure of words, focusing solely on their presence and count.\n\n### Formula\n\nLet \\( D \\) be a document containing words $( w_1, w_2, ..., w_n )$ from a vocabulary $(V)$.\n\nThe Bag of Words representation of $(D)$ can be defined as a vector $(\\mathbf{v}_D)$ where each element $(v_i)$ corresponds to the count of word $(w_i)$ in $(D)$:\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_D = [\\text{count}(w_1, D), \\text{count}(w_2, D), ..., \\text{count}(w_n, D)]$\n\nWhere $\\text{count}(w_i, D)$ is the number of times word $( w_i )$ appears in document $ D $.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the same sentences:\n\n1. \"I love apples\"\n2. \"I hate bananas\"\n3. \"I love oranges\"\n\nVocabulary: {I, love, apples, hate, bananas, oranges}\n\nFor \"I love apples\":\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{D1} = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]$\n\nFor \"I hate bananas\":\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{D2} = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]$\n\nFor \"I love oranges\":\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{D3} = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBag of Words is a fundamental technique in NLP for converting text into numerical features. While it has limitations like ignoring word order and context, its simplicity and effectiveness make it a useful starting point for many text processing and machine learning tasks.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'Text': [\n        'I love apples',\n        'I hate bananas',\n        'I love oranges',\n        'I love mango'\n    ],\n

sequences of n items (words, characters, etc.) from a given text or speech. They are used in NLP to capture the context of words by considering the surrounding words in a text.\n\n### Types of N-grams\n\n1. **Unigrams**: Single words (n=1)\n2. **Bigrams**: Pairs of consecutive words (n=2)\n3. **Trigrams**: Triples of consecutive words (n=3)\n4. **N-grams**: General form for sequences of n words\n\n### Example with a Small Dataset\n\nConsider the sentence: \"I love natural language processing\"\n\n**Unigrams** (n=1):\n\n| Unigram |\n|---------|\n| I       |\n| love    |\n| natural |\n| language|\n| processing |\n\n**Bigrams** (n=2):\n\n| Bigram                |\n|-----------------------|\n| I love                |\n| love natural          |\n| natural language      |\n| language processing   |\n\n**Trigrams** (n=3):\n\n| Trigram                     |\n|-----------------------------|\n| I love natural              |\n| love natural language       |\n| natural language processing |\n\n### Advantages of N-grams\n\n1. **Contextual Representation**: Bigrams and trigrams capture more context than unigrams by considering adjacent words.\n2. **Flexibility**: N-grams can be adjusted to capture different levels of context by changing the value of n.\n3. **Improved Performance**: Including bigrams and trigrams can improve the performance of models, especially in tasks like text classification and language modeling.\n\n### Disadvantages of N-grams\n\n1. **Data Sparsity**: As n increases, the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially, leading to sparse data issues.\n2. **Memory and Computation**: Higher-order n-grams require more memory and computational power to process and store.\n3. **Limited Long-range Context**: N-grams capture only a limited context and may miss long-range dependencies in the text.\n\n### Why Use N-grams in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\n1. **Context Preservation**: Unlike unigrams, bigrams and trigrams can preserve some word order and context information, which is crucial for many NLP tasks.\n2. **Feature Enrichment**: Using n-grams enriches the feature set for machine learning models, potentially leading to better performance.\n3. **Language Models**: N-grams are foundational in building statistical language models to predict the next word in a sequence.\n\n### Core Intuition of N-grams\n\nThe core intuition behind n-grams is to capture local context by considering contiguous sequences of words. This helps in understanding the syntactic and semantic relationships between words, improving the model's ability to process natural language.\n\n### Formula\n\nFor a given sequence of words $(S)$ = $([w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_m])$:\n\n1. **Unigram**: $(S)$ itself as $([w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_m])$\n2. **Bigram**: $((w_1, w_2), (w_2, w_3), \\ldots, (w_{m-1}, w_m))$\n3. **Trigram**: $((w_1, w_2, w_3), (w_2, w_3, w_4), \\ldots, (w_{m-2}, w_{m-1}, w_m))$\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the same sentence: \"I love natural language processing\"\n\n**Unigrams**:\n\n$ S_{uni} = [I, love, natural, language, processing] $\n\n**Bigrams**:\n\n$ S_{bi} = [(I, love), (love, natural), (natural, language), (language, processing)] $\n\n**Trigrams**:\n\n$ S_{tri} = [(I, love, natural), (love, natural, language), (natural, language, processing)] $\n\n### Conclusion\n\nN-grams are a fundamental concept in NLP for capturing the local context of words in a text. By considering sequences of words, n-grams help in preserving some syntactic and semantic relationships, making them useful for various NLP tasks such as text classification, language modeling, and feature extraction. Despite their limitations, n-grams provide a simple yet powerful way to enhance text representation and improve model performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'Text':

TF-IDF\n\n**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It combines two metrics: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).\n\n- **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. It is often normalized to prevent bias towards longer documents.\n- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how important a term is. It decreases the weight of terms that appear frequently in many documents and increases the weight of terms that appear in a few documents.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a corpus with three documents:\n\n1. \"I love apples\"\n2. \"I love bananas\"\n3. \"I love apples and bananas\"\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Term Frequency (TF)\n\n$$\n\\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d}\n$$\n\n| Document | Term     | TF      |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| D1       | I        | 1/3     |\n| D1       | love     | 1/3     |\n| D1       | apples   | 1/3     |\n| D2       | I        | 1/3     |\n| D2       | love     | 1/3     |\n| D2       | bananas  | 1/3     |\n| D3       | I        | 1/5     |\n| D3       | love     | 1/5     |\n| D3       | apples   | 1/5     |\n| D3       | and      | 1/5     |\n| D3       | bananas  | 1/5     |\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\n$$\n\\text{IDF}(t) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents}}{\\text{Number of documents containing term } t}\\right)\n$$\n\nIDF is calculated using the formula:\n$text{IDF}(t) = \\log \\left(\\frac{N}{df(t)}\\right) $\nwhere $ N $ is the total number of documents, and $ df(t) $ is the number of documents containing the term $ t $.\n\n| Term    | df(t) | IDF       |\n|---------|-------|-----------|\n| I       | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| love    | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| apples  | 2     | log(3/2) = 0.176|\n| bananas | 2     | log(3/2) = 0.176|\n| and     | 1     | log(3/1) = 0.477|\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate TF-IDF\n\nTF-IDF is calculated by multiplying TF and IDF for each term in each document.\n\n| Document | Term     | TF      | IDF       | TF-IDF        |\n|----------|----------|---------|-----------|---------------|\n| D1       | I        | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D1       | love     | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D1       | apples   | 1/3     | 0.176     | 0.059         |\n| D2       | I        | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D2       | love     | 1/3     | 0         | 0             |\n| D2       | bananas  | 1/3     | 0.176     | 0.059         |\n| D3       | I        | 1/5     | 0         | 0             |\n| D3       | love     | 1/5     | 0         | 0             |\n| D3       | apples   | 1/5     | 0.176     | 0.035         |\n| D3       | and      | 1/5     | 0.477     | 0.095         |\n| D3       | bananas  | 1/5     | 0.176     | 0.035         |\n\n### Advantages of TF-IDF\n\n1. **Simple to Understand**: TF-IDF is easy to compute and understand.\n2. **Effective**: Often effective for text representation in various NLP tasks like text classification and information retrieval.\n3. **Reduces Noise**: By reducing the weight of common terms, it helps in emphasizing more informative words.\n\n### Disadvantages of TF-IDF\n\n1. **High Dimensionality**: Like Bag of Words, it can result in high-dimensional feature vectors.\n2. **Context Ignorance**: Does not capture the semantic meaning or context of words.\n3. **Static Nature**: Needs to be recomputed if the corpus changes, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n\n### Why Use TF-IDF in NLP for Feature Extraction\n\n1. **Feature Weighting**: Provides a way to weight features based on their importance, making it useful for text mining and information retrieval.\n2. **Information Retrieval**: Helps in ranking documents based on relevance to a query by giving higher weight to rare but important terms.\n3. **Text Classification**: Enhances the performance of classifiers by focusing on significant words and ignoring common words that carry less information.\n\n### Core Intuition of TF-IDF\n\nThe core intuition behind TF-IDF is to assign higher weights to words that are important in a particular document but not common across the entire corpus. This helps in distinguishing documents based on their unique terms.\n\n### TF-IDF Formula\n\nThe TF-IDF value for a term $ t $ in a document $ d $ is calculated as:\n\n$ \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t) $\n\nwhere:\n- $ \\text{TF}(t, d) $ is the term frequency of $ t $ in document $ d $.\n- $ \\text{IDF}(t) $ is the inverse document frequency of term $ t $.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the sentence \"I love apples\":\n\n1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: \n\n| Term   | TF (raw count) | TF (normalized) |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------|\n| I      | 1              | 1/3             |\n| love   | 1              | 1/3             |\n| apples | 1              | 1/3             |\n\n2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:\n\n| Term   | df(t) | IDF                  |\n|--------|-------|----------------------|\n| I      | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| love   | 3     | log(3/3) = 0    |\n| apples | 2     | log(3/2) = 0.176|\n\n3. **TF-IDF Calculation**:\n\n| Term   | TF (normalized) | IDF      | TF-IDF       |\n|--------|-----------------|----------|--------------|\n| I      | 1/3             | 0        | 0            |\n| love   | 1/3             | 0        | 0            |\n| apples | 1/3             | 0.176    | 0.059        |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTF-IDF is a powerful technique for text feature extraction, offering a way to weigh terms by their importance in a document relative to a corpus. It reduces the influence of common terms and highlights unique terms, improving the effectiveness of information retrieval and text classification tasks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = {\n    'Text': [\n        'I love apples',\n        'I hate bananas',\n        'I love oranges',\n        'I love mango'\n    ],\n
