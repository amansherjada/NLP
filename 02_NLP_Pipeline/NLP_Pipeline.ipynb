    "## What is NLP Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "An NLP (Natural Language Processing) pipeline is a sequence of steps or processes used to analyze and interpret human language data. It transforms raw text data into a structured format that can be used for various applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. Hereâ€™s an overview of the typical stages in an NLP pipeline:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Text Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning and preparing the raw text data for further analysis. Common preprocessing tasks include:\r\n",
    "   - **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into smaller units called tokens (e.g., words, phrases).\r\n",
    "   - **Lowercasing**: Converting all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.\r\n",
    "   - **Stop Words Removal**: Removing common words that do not contribute much meaning (e.g., \"and\", \"the\").\r\n",
    "   - **Punctuation Removal**: Stripping out punctuation marks.\r\n",
    "   - **Lemmatization/Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Text Representation**: Converting the cleaned text into a format that can be used by machine learning models. Common methods include:\r\n",
    "   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Representing text as a collection of its words, disregarding grammar and word order.\r\n",
    "   - **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Weighing the importance of words in the text based on their frequency and how unique they are across documents.\r\n",
    "   - **Word Embeddings**: Representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the text data that can be used for modeling. This might include:\r\n",
    "   - **N-grams**: Extracting contiguous sequences of n tokens.\r\n",
    "   - **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical parts of speech for each token.\r\n",
    "   - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Model Building**: Using the features extracted to train machine learning or deep learning models. Common models include:\r\n",
    "   - **Classifiers**: Such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks for tasks like sentiment analysis or spam detection.\r\n",
    "   - **Sequence Models**: Such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for tasks like language modeling or machine translation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Post-Processing**: Refining the output of the model to improve usability. This may involve:\r\n",
    "   - **Decoding**: Converting model outputs back into human-readable text (e.g., translating model-generated tokens into sentences).\r\n",
    "   - **Aggregation**: Combining model outputs for final decision-making (e.g., ensemble methods).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "7. **Deployment**: Integrating the NLP model into an application or service, making it available for end-users.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These steps can be iterated and refined to improve the performance and accuracy of the NLP system."
